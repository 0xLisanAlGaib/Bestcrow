## üöÄ Quick Start

### Creating an Escrow

```solidity
function createEscrow(
    address token,    // Use address(0) for ETH
    uint256 amount,   // Amount to escrow
    uint256 expiryDate,   // Timestamp for expiration
    address receiver,  // Recipient address
    string memory title,  // Title of the agreement
    string memory description  // Detailed description
) external payable returns (uint256 escrowId)
```

### Accepting an Escrow

```solidity
function acceptEscrow(
    uint256 escrowId  // ID of the escrow to accept
) external payable
```

## üîÑ How It Works

### 1. Escrow Creation

- Depositor initiates by providing:
  - Asset type (ETH or ERC20 token address)
  - Transaction amount
  - Expiration timestamp
  - Receiver's address
  - Title and description of the agreement
- System requirements:
  - Amount must be greater than 0
  - Receiver cannot be the zero address or depositor
  - Expiry date must be in the future
  - Title cannot be empty
  - Depositor transfers full amount + 0.5% fee

### 2. Receiver Acceptance

- Requirements:
  - Must be the specified receiver
  - Must accept before expiry date
  - Must provide exactly 50% collateral
  - Cannot accept if already active
- Process:
  - Transfers collateral to contract
  - Marks escrow as active
  - Emits EscrowAccepted event

### 3. Transaction Flow

- **Standard Flow**:
  1. Receiver requests release via `requestRelease`
  2. Depositor approves via `approveRelease`
  3. Contract transfers:
     - Original amount to receiver
     - Collateral returned to receiver
     - Fee stored in contract
- **Alternative Flows**:
  - **Rejection**: Receiver can reject before accepting, full refund to depositor
  - **Expiration**: Depositor can claim refund after expiry if not accepted
  - **Fee Management**: Owner can withdraw accumulated fees per token

## üîí Security

### Security Measures

- **Smart Contract Security**:
  - OpenZeppelin's secure components:
    - ReentrancyGuard for all value transfers
    - SafeERC20 for token operations
    - Ownable for fee management
  - Strict input validation
  - State machine pattern for escrow lifecycle
  - Event emission for all state changes
